# Patch management SLAs (MTTR targets by severity, exception tracking)

**MUST** define mean-time-to-remediate targets per severity (critical 24h, high 30d, medium 90d) and log every exception with owner and expiry date.

**Why:** Undated exceptions silently become permanent debt; SLA clocks make drift visible and auditable.

**Detect:** `sla` / `mttr` keys in policy docs, `waiver` / `exception` tracker files with `expires` fields
