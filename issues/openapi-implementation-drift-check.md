# OpenAPI–Implementation Drift Check

**SHOULD** verify in CI that the served API matches its OpenAPI spec (request/response validation against the contract), failing on drift.

**Why:** A spec that lies is worse than no spec: consumers code against documented behavior the implementation quietly diverged from, and breaking changes ship "documented as safe."

**Detect:** check CI for contract tests (Dredd, Schemathesis, Prism, schemathesis fuzz mode), response-middleware spec validation, or oasdiff between released spec versions.
