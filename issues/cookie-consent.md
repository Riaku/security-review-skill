# Cookie Consent

**SHOULD** block non-essential cookies until explicit user consent is obtained, with granular category controls.

**Why:** Setting tracking cookies before consent violates ePrivacy Directive and GDPR, exposing sites to regulatory fines and user distrust.

**Detect:** grep for analytics/advertising cookie initialization before consent check; inspect `CookieConsent`, `googleAnalytics`, `fbq` calls preceding consent gate.

**References:** ePrivacy Directive Art. 5(3), GDPR Recital 30, IAB TCF v2.3
