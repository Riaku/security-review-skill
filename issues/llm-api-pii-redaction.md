# PII redaction and DPAs before sending data to third-party LLM APIs

**MUST** redact or tokenize PII and execute a DPA with the provider before payloads leave the trust boundary.

**Why:** Personal data reaching an external model API may be logged, retained, or trained on beyond compliance scope.

**Detect:** outbound LLM calls without redaction middleware; missing DPA or zero-retention agreement in vendor records.
