# HIPAA (health data)

**MUST** safeguard protected health information with access controls, encryption in transit, and audit logs covering every system in the HIPAA covered entity or business associate chain.

**Why:** Unlogged PHI access and plaintext transmissions drive the largest class of healthcare breaches and OCR enforcement actions.

**Detect:** grep for PHI/ePHI handling without encryption/TLS, missing audit logging, third-party analytics SDKs receiving patient data.
