# Human-in-the-loop approval for destructive agent tool calls

**MUST** require explicit human confirmation before an autonomous agent executes destructive actions (deletes, payments, sends, deploys).

**Why:** A hijacked or hallucinating agent with unguarded write access can cause irreversible damage in a single automated chain.

**Detect:** agent tool registry lacks confirm/approval flags on destructive verbs; auto-execute=true on write-capable tools.
