# Agent Verification Loop (Executable Done-When)

**MUST** give every AI-agent coding task a runnable pass/fail verification criterion (tests, build, script-vs-fixture) wired into the task itself — otherwise the human becomes the verification loop.

**Why:** Industry practice converges on this: an agent without an executable check ships plausible-looking code indefinitely.

**Detect:** agent task/plan artifacts merged with no named test/build/acceptance command; "implement X" tickets with no check; agent PRs whose CI runs no tests on the change.
