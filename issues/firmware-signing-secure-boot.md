# Firmware Signing & Secure Boot

**MUST** sign firmware images and enforce signature verification at boot (secure boot chain) so unsigned or tampered images cannot run on devices.

**Why:** Unsigned firmware is the ultimate persistence layer — an attacker who flashes once owns the device permanently and it survives every software remediation.

**Detect:** grep build pipeline for signing steps (`osslsigncode`, `imgtool`, HSM calls); check bootloader verify-enforce (not just verify-log) mode; look for dev/test keys shipped in production images.
