# Treat LLM output as untrusted input (sanitize before HTML/SQL/shell/URL sinks)

**MUST** sanitize or parameterize every LLM output before it reaches an HTML, SQL, shell, or URL sink.

**Why:** A coerced model emitting markup or queries delivers stored XSS and injection through a path teams assume is safe.

**Detect:** model response rendered via |safe / innerHTML or concatenated into queries or subprocess args.
